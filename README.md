## Recommendations  


- Maintain stock of customer favorites, such as chocolate cakes, ensuring that high-demand items are always available.  
- While maintaining the supply of chocolate cakes due to high demand, increase marketing efforts for high-margin flavors like vanilla and mango.  
- Increase marketing efforts in moderately performing locations through localized advertising and community engagement.  
  - Conduct market research to understand the specific preferences and challenges in low-performing locations.  
- Continue to analyze sales and delivery trends, especially during peak hours (3 PM - 6 PM).  
  - Use this data to optimize staff allocation and inventory levels during busy periods.  
  - Consider investing in additional delivery resources or partnering with third-party delivery services during high-demand periods.  
- Regularly analyze sales data and customer feedback to identify emerging trends and areas for improvement.
